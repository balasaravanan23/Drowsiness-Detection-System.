 “Real-time driver drowsiness detection using CNN, Mediapipe, and Eye Aspect Ratio.”
# 🚗💤 Drowsiness Detection System

This project detects driver drowsiness in real-time using:
- **Mediapipe** for face and eye landmarks
- **CNN model** for eye state classification
- **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** for geometric validation
- An alarm sound when drowsiness is detected
